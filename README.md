# PFCAD-dataset

We propose a parametric and feature-based CAD dataset to learn complicated 3D shape features and to comply with human vision.

This is the first version of PFCAD dataset, and the data size will continuously increase in the future for further research.

Here are some samples of PFCAD dataset.

Samples of the parametric CAD models generated from PFCAD dataset with real-world engineering features to comply with semantics of the human CAD engineers are shown below.
